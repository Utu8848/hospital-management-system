# hospital-management-system
 A Python-based hospital management system with block diagrams

A comprehensive Hospital Management System (HMS), developed using Python to streamline and automate various hospital operations. This system enhances the efficiency and management of healthcare services by simplifying tasks like doctor registration, patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor-patient management, and management report generation, which includes diagrammatic reports for ease of understanding.

Key Features:

1. Doctor Registration: Allows hospital staff to add new doctors to the system, capturing essential details such as specialties.

2. Patient Registration: Allows for seamless entry of patient details, medical history, and contact information.

3. Edit Patient and Doctor Details: Provides the functionality to update patient and doctor information after initial registration to keep records current.

4. Appointment Scheduling: Enables patients to book appointments with available doctors, reducing wait times and administrative workload.

5. Doctor and Patient Management: Manages doctor profiles and assigns and relocates patients to respective doctors based on availability.

6. Patient Grouping Based on Family: Allows for grouping patients based on family ties, simplifying management of related patient records.

7. Management Report Generation: Generates comprehensive reports for hospital management, including:

 - Total number of doctors and the number of patients assigned to each doctor

 - Number of appointments per month for each doctor

 - Number of patients based on illness type

8. Diagrammatic Report Generation: Used to generate diagrammatic reports based on the management report for ease of understanding, providing visual charts and graphs to aid in data analysis.

This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming aimed at improving hospital efficiency and patient care.
