# hospital-management-system
 A Python-based hospital management system with block diagrams

A comprehensive **Hospital Management System (HMS)**, developed using **Python** to streamline and automate various hospital operations. This system enhances the efficiency and management of healthcare services by simplifying tasks like doctor registration, patient registration, appointment scheduling, doctor-patient management, and management report generation, which includes diagrammatic reports for ease of understanding.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

1. **Doctor Registration**: Allows hospital staff to add new doctors to the system, capturing essential details such as specialties.
2. **Patient Registration**: Seamless entry of patient details, medical history, and contact information.
3. **Edit Patient and Doctor Details**: Provides the functionality to update patient and doctor information to keep records current.
4. **Appointment Scheduling**: Enables patients to book appointments with available doctors, reducing wait times and administrative workload.
5. **Doctor and Patient Management**: Manages doctor profiles and assigns or relocates patients to respective doctors based on availability.
6. **Patient Grouping Based on Family**: Groups patients based on family ties, simplifying management of related patient records.
7. **Management Report Generation**: Generates comprehensive reports for hospital management, including:
   - Total number of doctors and the number of patients assigned to each doctor
   - Number of appointments per month for each doctor
   - Number of patients based on illness type
8. **Diagrammatic Report Generation**: Generates visual charts and graphs based on management reports to aid in data analysis.
